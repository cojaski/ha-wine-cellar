"""Bottle photos on disk, served over HTTP instead of inlined in the payload.

Photos used to live in the wine records as base64 `data:` URLs. A wine's
metadata is around 640 bytes; a 640px label photo is tens of kilobytes, so a
cellar entered by photo shipped several megabytes through the websocket on
every load — and again after every add, move or edit, since the card reloads
the list each time.

Here the bytes live in a directory and the wine keeps a short URL. The
browser fetches each photo once and caches it: the filename carries a stamp,
so replacing a photo produces a new URL and the cache cannot serve a stale
one.

Backups are the deliberate exception. `inline_for_backup` reads the files
back into data URLs so a backup stays a single self-contained file — that
cost is paid when a backup is made, not on every page load.
